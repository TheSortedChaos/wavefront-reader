# History

Here you can see some documentation about the project history.

I decided to play around with [LightWeight Java Game Engine][lwjgl] once again.
Therefor I need some data structure to represent some geometry data.
Because I need some tools like [Blender][blender] to create geometry data, I need _something_ (a data structure) between [Blender][blender] and my [LWJGL][lwjgl]-project.
This _something_ will be: the [wavefront file format][wavefront] ([Wikipedia][wavefront-wiki])
It's:
* human readable
* easy to understand/implement
* [Blender][blender] can export to that file format
